# ApiVideo Live Stream Migration

This project has been successfully migrated from `rtmp_broadcaster` to `apivideo_live_stream` for improved live streaming functionality.

## Changes Made

### Dependencies Updated
- ✅ Replaced `rtmp_broadcaster: ^2.3.4` with `apivideo_live_stream: ^1.2.7`
- ✅ Added `wakelock_plus: ^1.2.5` to keep device awake during streaming
- ✅ Kept existing `camera`, `permission_handler` dependencies

### Platform Configuration
- ✅ **Android**: Added `screenOrientation="landscape"` to force landscape mode
- ✅ **iOS**: Restricted orientations to landscape only (`UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft`, `UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight`)
- ✅ Permissions already configured: `CAMERA`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`

### App Architecture
- ✅ **New Service**: `ApiVideoLiveStreamService` replaces `RTMPStreamingService`
- ✅ **Lifecycle Management**: Implements `WidgetsBindingObserver` for proper app lifecycle handling
- ✅ **Orientation Lock**: Forces landscape mode throughout the app
- ✅ **Provider Integration**: Added to main app providers

### Features Implemented
- ✅ **Live Streaming**: Complete flow with `ApiVideoLiveStreamController`
- ✅ **Camera Preview**: Uses `ApiVideoCameraPreview` widget
- ✅ **Controls**:
  - Camera switching (front/back)
  - Mute/unmute microphone
  - Start/stop streaming
  - Watermark opacity control
- ✅ **Status Handling**: Real-time UI feedback for connection events
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error display with dismiss options
- ✅ **Wakelock**: Keeps device awake during streaming

### Screen Layout
- ✅ **Landscape-Only**: Optimized layout for landscape orientation
- ✅ **Split Layout**: Camera preview (3/5) + controls (2/5)
- ✅ **Overlay Elements**: Live indicator, camera controls, watermark
- ✅ **Glass Card UI**: Modern translucent controls design

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Replace Watermark Image
Replace `assets/watermarks/default_watermark.png.placeholder` with your actual watermark:
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
- Rename to `default_watermark.png`

### 3. Configure ApiVideo Credentials
Update your app configuration to use ApiVideo streaming endpoints instead of direct YouTube RTMP URLs.

### 4. Test the Implementation
- Build and run the app
- Navigate to Go Live screen
- Test camera preview, controls, and streaming functionality

## Production Considerations

1. **Stream Key Management**: Ensure proper stream key handling in your backend
2. **Error Recovery**: App handles connection failures and provides retry mechanisms
3. **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of camera resources and controllers
4. **Orientation Handling**: App locked to landscape for consistent streaming experience
5. **Performance**: Optimized for smooth camera preview and streaming

## Notes

- The app now forces landscape orientation throughout for optimal streaming experience
- All RTMP broadcaster code has been removed and replaced with ApiVideo implementation
- Watermark functionality is preserved and enhanced
- Error handling includes user-friendly feedback with snackbars and status indicators
